## May the requesting AI approve itself?

```diagram
AI’s change request
↓ Separate human review and approval
Only the approved scope becomes eligible
```

An authorized human makes a separate decision. The agent adapter does not approve or execute. Preserve the distinction between what was requested and what was actually authorized.

<!-- DEPTH -->

### Why this responsibility exists

Separate extraction from truth and preserve immutable review outcomes. Revalidate evidence access inside the write transaction.

### Inputs and outputs

Input: Typed candidates, creator access context, reviewer identity and decision.

Output: One immutable approval/rejection outcome and, on approval, canonical records.

### What must be preserved

- Proposal identity/payload, SUPPORTED_BY lineage, Approval history.
- MCP cannot approve or reject. A pending proposal cannot acquire conflicting review outcomes. Authorization uses current evidence ACLs.

### Follow the example

A reviewer must be authorized to read the note and compare it with the candidate. The AI submitting through MCP cannot perform this approval.

### Avoid this misconception

MCP cannot approve or reject. A pending proposal cannot acquire conflicting review outcomes. Authorization uses current evidence ACLs.
