A successor links to its predecessor and must not invert effective intervals. Existing implementation does not establish complete temporal verification.

<!-- DEPTH -->

### Why this responsibility exists

Represent inspectable semantic claims and retain correction/supersession history.

### Inputs and outputs

Input: An approved AssertionChange with evidence, predicate and temporal fields.

Output: Canonical Assertion reads and graph relationships.

### What must be preserved

- Claim predicate/value, evidence link, confidence, temporal and extraction provenance.
- Canonical promotion requires approval. A superseding assertion preserves subject and predicate and must not silently erase its predecessor.

### Follow the example

Evidence that two technologies were reviewed together does not establish that one uses the other. Review whether the proposed claim is stronger than its evidence.

### Avoid this misconception

Canonical promotion requires approval. A superseding assertion preserves subject and predicate and must not silently erase its predecessor.
